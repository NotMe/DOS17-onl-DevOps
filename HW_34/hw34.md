## 1

Установить Terraform.

```
terraform.exe -v
Terraform v1.6.6
on windows_amd64
```


## 2

Написать шаблон для создания виртуальной машины в облаке

```
terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "~> 4.16"
    }
  }

  required_version = ">= 1.2.0"
}

provider "aws" {
  region  = "eu-north-1"
}

resource "aws_instance" "app_server" {
  ami           = "ami-067f3514568fd5760"
  instance_type = "t3.micro"

  tags = {
    Name = "ExampleAppServerInstance"
  }
}
```


## 3

 Познакомиться с командами:
- terraform init
- terraform fmt
- terraform validate
- terraform plan
- terraform apply
- terraform destroy

```

```


## 4

Создать виртуальную машину в облаке при помощи ранее созданного шаблона.

```
terraform.exe apply

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

Поменять тип виртуальной машины (увеличить количество ресурсов) через веб консоль и выполнить terraform plan. Что предлагает сделать Terraform?

```
terraform.exe plan 
aws_instance.app_server: Refreshing state... [id=i-03fe1374949ad7758]

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  ~ update in-place

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # aws_instance.app_server will be updated in-place
  ~ resource "aws_instance" "app_server" {
        id                                   = "i-03fe1374949ad7758"
      ~ instance_type                        = "t3.nano" -> "t3.micro"
        tags                                 = {
            "Name" = "ExampleAppServerInstance"
        }
        # (28 unchanged attributes hidden)

        # (9 unchanged blocks hidden)
    }

Plan: 0 to add, 1 to change, 0 to destroy.
